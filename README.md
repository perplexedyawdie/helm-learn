> My aim is to make it as straightforward as possible to understand the basics of using Helm. I've provided Docker container enviroments that are pre-configured with all the tools needed. That way you can focus less on configuring and more on learning. Each section has an overview of the topic, key concepts and practical exercises that will get you comfortable with using the tool. I hope you find value here! ‚òÅ
